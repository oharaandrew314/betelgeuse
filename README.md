## TODO
- Start emulated Redis Servers on the ports of your choice
- Right click on keys to delete
- get and set values for the different data-types (e.g. set)
- Connection Management Dialog to create, edit, select, delete connections
- alternate key navigator: tree view
- perform backend tasks in background (don't lock up GUI)
- Connect via SSH Tunnel
- build native distributables (https://github.com/beryx-gist/badass-runtime-example-javafx)
